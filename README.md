# **Pomodoro Application**

## About
A GUI application of Pomodoro timer developed in Python using the Tkinter package. It implements the Pomodoro technique, which is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. It breaks work into intervals, typically 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Each interval is known as a pomodoro, from the Italian word for tomato.
The Pomodoro technique has six steps:
1. Decide on the task to be done.
2. Set the Pomodoro timer (typically for 25 minutes).
3. Work on the task.
4. End work when the timer rings and take a short break (typically 5 minutes).
5. Go back to Step 2 and repeat until you complete four pomodori.
6. After four pomodori are done, take a long break (typically 20 minutes) instead of a short break. Once the long break is finished, return to step 2.
